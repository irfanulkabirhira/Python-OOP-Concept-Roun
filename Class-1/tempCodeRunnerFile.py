        print("Book List:", [book.book_name for book in cls.book_list])  # Using list comprehension


# âœ… Creating Book Objects and Storing in Class Attribute
book1 = Library("Python Basics")

Library.book_list = [book1, book2, book3]  # âœ… Storing objects manually in class attribute

# âœ… Showing details of one book
print("ðŸ“Œ One Book Detail:")
book1.show_details()  # Output: Book Name: Python Basics

# âœ… Showing the full book list
print("\nðŸ“Œ All Books in Library:")
Library.show_all_books()  # Output: Book List: ['Python Basics', 'Data Science', 'Machine Learning']
